# acme-web-design

This is our first web page called acme-web-design and i did this project simply by watching the video.
to tell frankly it is not much difficult but get alot of new skills on this project specially on how to create responsive web pages using css, working step by step on different branches with out modifying the orginal/master one.

working with branches, creating more attractive responsive user-interfaces using html & css, coding on white paper from scratch are some of the good practices that I have to develop further.
