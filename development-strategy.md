I broke this simple project to 7 steps in 7 branches.
and in each steps/branches i added/updated new codes

- _At first I create the index/home page with simple header with navigation menus and the footer, so that the users can navigate to the different pages easily_

- _Then I updated the index page and added showcase, newsletter, and boxes to the home/index page so that the users can subscribe or register for newsletters simply by putting their email in the text box and by clicking subscribe button_

- _Then I added the cascading stylesheet to my project to make the project pages more attractive, user-friendly and responsive. so that, the users can find attractive and easy to use pages in different devices._

- _At the 6th step/branch i added about page to the project by creating a simple file about.html so that the users can read and find information about us._
- _Then I added services page to the project by creating services.html so that the users can read about the services we offer by clicking services in the navigation menu_
